xkeylog:
========

  a really dumb keylogger for X11 that can wraps around the xinput.

usage:
------

  $ xkeylog.sh <id> >> <logfile>

    where <id> is the ID of the X input device of the keyboard.  This can be
  found by running xinput and looking at the second column.

requirements:
-------------

  xinput must be installed and be in the $PATH.

output:
-------

    each key press / key release is printed on a new line along with the
  keycode.  To find out your keymap, you can execute `xmodmap -pk`.
